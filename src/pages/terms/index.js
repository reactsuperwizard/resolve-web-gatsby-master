              Service, together with the privacy and any other legal notices and
              agreements published by Resolve on the Website, shall constitute
              the entire agreement between you and Resolve Corp. concerning the
              Website. If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid
              by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
              provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
              provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force
              and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Use shall
              be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other
              term, and Resolve's failure to assert any right or provision under
              these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
              provision. YOU AND RESOLVE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING
              OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE WEBSITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR
              AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION
              SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Resolve may provide disclosures required by law relating to the
                Resolve Services and any other information about your legal
                rights and duties and your account to you electronically.

              <li>
                Resolve may send any communications, billing statements, or
                required disclosures, such as initial and annual privacy notices
                (together, “Disclosures”) to you electronically via our website
                or to the email address or mobile telephone number that you have
                provided to us, either directly or indirectly via the merchant
                to whom Resolve will send funds on your behalf.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resolve may notify you via email when the Disclosures are
                available. The Disclosures will be available for at least 30
                days and will be provided to you in a format that can either be
                printed or downloaded for your records. Whenever we send you an
                email or text message regarding the Disclosures, that email or
                text message will contain instructions regarding how to view the
                Disclosures.

                This consent applies to any transaction undertaken through the
                Services in the past, to all future disclosures and
                communications on your account, to all future transactions in

                us, and to other Disclosures that we provide to you by email.

              provide to you electronically shall have the same meaning and
              effect as if provided in paper form. A text message or email
              alerting you that Disclosures are available electronically,
              provided that the Disclosures are made available online shall have
              the same meaning and effect as if Resolve had provided those
              Disclosures to you in paper form, regardless of whether you
              actually view those Disclosures, unless you have withdrawn your
              consent pursuant to Section 3, above, prior to receiving such
              Disclosures.
